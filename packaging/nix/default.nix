# ONNX Runtime, fetched hermetically instead of by ort-sys at build time.
#
# ort-sys's build script downloads this exact archive from cdn.pyke.io, which a
# sandboxed build correctly blocks — so `nix build .#visage` could never work
# offline. Pointing ORT_LIB_LOCATION at nixpkgs' onnxruntime does not help
# either: ort links STATICALLY by default and nixpkgs ships only .so, so the
# build fails with "could not link to the ONNX Runtime build in ...".
#
# So fetch the same archive ort-sys wants, pinned by hash. Version-matched by
# construction (1.23.2 — what ort 2.0.0-rc.11 expects), no version skew, and
# reproducible. The payload is a single flat libonnxruntime.a; it is installed
# to BOTH $out and $out/lib because ort-sys probes both.
#
# The archive is raw LZMA2, NOT an .xz container — `tar xf` reports "does not
# look like a tar archive". It needs `xz --format=raw --lzma2`.

    longDescription = ''
      Visage is the Windows Hello equivalent for Linux. It authenticates sudo,
      login, and any PAM-gated service using your face — with sub-second response
      and no subprocess overhead. Built in Rust with a persistent daemon model,
      SCRFD face detection, and ArcFace recognition via ONNX Runtime.

      The default face authentication layer for Augmentum OS.
      Ships standalone on any Linux system.
