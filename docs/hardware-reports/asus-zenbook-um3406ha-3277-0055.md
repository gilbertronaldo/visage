# Hardware Report: ASUS Zenbook 14 UM3406HA (Shinetech `3277:0055`)

**Date tested:** 2026-08-17
**Result:** IR-capable and PAM-functional on ambient infrared. **No emitter quirk** for this
module, and passive liveness does not discriminate a live face from a screen spoof here.
**Validation level:** Full end-to-end — enrollment, D-Bus verify, PAM `sudo` path, and a first
spoof attempt. Read-only on the USB control surface; no UVC control writes were sent.

## Summary

This is the same laptop model Visage names as reference hardware in
[`hardware-compatibility.md`](../hardware-compatibility.md) — ASUS Zenbook 14 UM3406HA — but
carrying a **different camera module** than the one the shipped quirk covers.

`contrib/hw/04f2-b6d9.toml` is titled *"ASUS Zenbook 14 UM3406HA IR Camera"* and keyed to
Chicony `04F2:B6D9`. This unit carries Shinetech `3277:0055`. ASUS ships this chassis with at
least two camera modules, so **the model name does not predict emitter support** —
`visage discover` does, and it reports `no quirk` on all four nodes here.

Three consequences, in order of severity:

1. **A hand-held phone screen matched the enrolled identity at 0.9013 similarity**, and its
   landmark displacement was *higher* than two genuine live attempts. On this module the
   landmark-stability metric does not separate live from spoof. See
   [Liveness measurements](#liveness-measurements).
2. **Passive liveness rejects live users 13–17% of the time** on this sensor (20/23–20/24
   live pass, as of the journal at 2026-08-17 13:43 local).
3. **The IR emitter fires anyway — and the daemon says otherwise.** Despite having no quirk,
   the emitter strobes lit/unlit every frame by firmware default. The log line
   `no IR emitter quirk for device; proceeding without illumination` is therefore misleading:
   the quirk is absent, the illumination is not. See
   [the emitter section](#-the-ir-emitter-is-active-on-this-module-with-no-quirk).

⛔ **CORRECTED 2026-09-16 — the strobe is NOT a usable anti-spoof primitive here, and the
physical reasoning below was backwards.** This paragraph originally read: *"A live face reflects
the emitter and alternates strongly; a self-emissive display does not. That is a physical
discriminator the landmark-stability metric provably lacks here."* It was measured and it is
false.

`visage test --strobe` streams raw frames (no CLAHE, one stream) and reports the brightness
swing between adjacent lit/unlit halves, on the brightest decile of pixels as a face proxy.
Same session, same distance, 43 adjacent pairs each:

| condition | mean | sd | min | median | max |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| live face | 119.73 | 7.50 | 98.93 | 123.38 | 125.57 |
| phone screen | **205.28** | 56.63 | 105.51 | 247.85 | 253.84 |

**The spoof swings 1.71× MORE than the live face.** A phone's glass is specular and mirrors the
emitter straight back; skin is diffuse and absorbs much of it. The original claim neglected
specular reflection entirely.

⛔ **And the metric is attacker-controllable, which is what actually disqualifies it.** The
spoof's delta decayed smoothly across a single 3-second hold as the phone tilted —
`248 249 250 252 253 254 251 231 200 185 170 155 139 121 113 106` — and its last 8 pairs landed
**inside the live band**. Nobody was attempting evasion; a hand moved. An attacker need only
hold the screen at the angle that already sits in the live range, and the trace proves that
angle exists and is trivially found.

A fitted threshold (`delta < 126`, chosen as the live maximum) gives 100% live acceptance and
19% spoof acceptance, Youden J = 0.814. That looks respectable and is not: the threshold was
fitted to this very sample, so its live-acceptance is optimistic, and the 19% is exactly the
attacker-selectable tail.

⚠️ Untested and likely to behave oppositely: a **matte printed photo** is diffuse like skin, so
this metric would probably miss it altogether. Any future work here must test print spoofs, not
just screens.

Raw data: [`data/strobe-3277-0055-live.tsv`](data/strobe-3277-0055-live.tsv) and
[`data/strobe-3277-0055-phone-spoof.tsv`](data/strobe-3277-0055-phone-spoof.tsv). n=1 operator,
n=1 spoof device, one session — the same sample limits this report already flags for liveness.

Prior art on this exact machine: under Ubuntu 24.04 it ran Howdy 2.6.1 with
`linux-enable-ir-emitter` 7.0.0-beta2 and reached **10/10 consecutive `sudo` authentications**,
also observing the strobe (reported there as ~35% dark frames).

## Camera discovery

```text
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 3277:0055 Shinetech USB2.0 FHD UVC WebCam

$ visage discover
/dev/video0  driver=uvcvideo  VID=0x3277 PID=0x0055  no quirk (VID=0x3277 PID=0x0055)
/dev/video1  driver=uvcvideo  VID=0x3277 PID=0x0055  no quirk (VID=0x3277 PID=0x0055)
/dev/video2  driver=uvcvideo  VID=0x3277 PID=0x0055  no quirk (VID=0x3277 PID=0x0055)
/dev/video3  driver=uvcvideo  VID=0x3277 PID=0x0055  no quirk (VID=0x3277 PID=0x0055)
```

Four nodes, two streams. `ID_V4L_PRODUCT` disambiguates them:

| Nodes | `ID_V4L_PRODUCT` suffix | Stream |
|---|---|---|
| `/dev/video0`, `/dev/video1` | `USB2.0 F` | RGB |
| `/dev/video2`, `/dev/video3` | `USB2.0 I` | **Infrared** |

Configure `camera = "/dev/video2"`. Note the spoof result below before assuming the IR node
by itself defeats a displayed photograph — it did not defeat an emissive phone screen.

## Capture quality

```text
$ visage test
Opening /dev/video2...
  Format: GREY 640x360
Capturing 10 frames...
  Captured: 10 good, 9 dark skipped
Average brightness: 59.5
```

### ⚠️ The IR emitter IS active on this module, with no quirk

This is the most consequential finding in this report, and it contradicts the daemon's own
log line. A 20-frame capture shows **clean per-frame strobe alternation**:

```text
$ visage test -n 20
[0] 82.7   [1] 32.0   [2] 81.5   [3] 32.7   [4] 80.7   [5] 33.7
[6] 81.6   [7] 34.7   [8] 83.1   [9] 36.0  [10] 85.2  [11] 36.5  …
```

Lit frames ~81–85, unlit ~32–39, alternating every frame. Visual comparison of an adjacent
pair confirms the mechanism: **the face and room interior go black in the unlit frame, while
the outdoor scene through a window is unchanged** — sunlight is IR-rich, so distant content
stays lit while the emitter's own illumination reaches only nearby subjects.

The strobe was present in the **first** capture of the session, before any external tool was
fetched or run, so it is firmware-default (or persisted) — not something we induced. The 9
"dark skipped" frames in that cold 10-frame run were the **unlit half of the strobe**, filtered
out of the printed list; they were never an exposure artifact.

**Therefore `no IR emitter quirk for device; proceeding without illumination` is misleading.**
The quirk is genuinely absent — `visage discover` is correct about that — but illumination is
*present*. Absence of a quirk entry does not imply absence of illumination on hardware whose
firmware enables face-auth mode by default. The message conflates the two.

Auto-exposure additionally ramps across a cold capture (52.8 → 68.0), which is a separate and
much smaller effect.

The sensor is **640×360**, not the 640×480 that `DEFAULT_MIN_EYE_DISPLACEMENT` was calibrated
against.

Visual inspection of a captured frame confirms a clearly resolved, well-exposed face on
ambient IR alone in a normally-lit room.

## Enrollment and authentication

Enrolled via `sudo visage onboard` — 7 models across `normal`, `left`, `right`, `glasses`,
quality **0.7404–0.8685**.

PAM is wired at order 900 in `sudo` and `login`:

```text
auth [success=done default=ignore]  pam_visage.so   # visage (order 900)
auth sufficient                     pam_unix.so     # fallback
auth required                       pam_deny.so
```

The `sudo` path was exercised end to end, including fallback:

```text
pam_visage: no match for user 'cc'
op=PAM:authentication grantors=pam_unix acct="cc" res=success
```

**Identity matching never failed** across 12 attempts. Similarity ranged **0.4609–0.9847**
against a 0.40 threshold.

**Live pass rate fails the ≥9-in-10 bar in [`STATUS.md`](../STATUS.md).**

Stated as-of a fixed window rather than a live rate, since the figure moves with every
attempt — `visaged` journal, **2026-08-17 13:43:15 local**:

| | |
|---|---|
| Post-enrollment verify attempts | **25** |
| Matched | **20** |
| Non-matches | **5** — of which **1 was the deliberate spoof** (a correct rejection) and 1 has unestablished provenance |
| Live pass rate | **20/23 = 87%** to **20/24 = 83%**, depending on the ambiguous sample |

Every live failure was the liveness gate vetoing a face it had **already recognised** — never
an identity miss. The rate swung 82% → 100% → back across sub-runs with no variable held
fixed, so treat the point estimate as weak in either direction.

## Liveness measurements

Threshold in force: `liveness_min_displacement = 0.80` px, `verify_n = 3` frames.

The daemon logs displacement only on rejection, so passing attempts are known to be ≥0.80 but
their margin is unmeasured — raising `logLevel` to `debug` exposes it via the
`"liveness check"` trace in `engine.rs`.

| Subject | Similarity | Displacement | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| Live — `onboard` auto-verify | 0.9847 | **0.263** | rejected |
| Live — via PAM `sudo` | 0.8793 | **0.670** | rejected |
| Live ×9 | 0.4609–0.8759 | ≥0.80 | passed |
| **Phone screen, hand-held** | **0.9013** | **0.681** | rejected by floor |
| Unattributed¹ | 0.7951 | 0.306 | rejected |
| Live — post-rebuild, gen 9 | 0.8531 | **0.492** | rejected |

¹ Provenance not established — either a third sub-floor live sample or an earlier spoof
attempt. Recorded rather than assigned.

**The spoof's displacement exceeds the live minimum.** No threshold on this metric admits the
0.263 live sample while rejecting the 0.681 spoof. Lowering the floor to fix the 82% pass rate
would admit the spoof. The gate currently blocks it only because 0.80 is high enough to reject
most things, live faces included.

**Hypothesis (untested):** the metric cannot distinguish ocular micro-saccades from tremor in
the hand holding the spoof. `liveness.rs` documents *"a printed photo produces <0.3 px (sensor
noise only)"* — which describes a **mounted, static** photo. The settling test: mount the
phone on a stand and re-measure. If displacement drops below 0.3, tremor is confirmed as the
confound.

**Sample size is n=1 on the spoof side.** This is recorded as a measurement, not yet as a
threat-model revision.

## Resolution on this host (2026-08-17)

`liveness.minDisplacement` lowered **0.8 → 0.1**. 0.1 sits ~5× below the lowest live
displacement measured (0.263), so every live sample passes, while still rejecting a **rigidly
mounted** photo — the only spoof shape this metric catches. Chosen over disabling liveness
because it is strictly more restrictive at identical UX cost.

**Measured after the change:** 15 verify attempts, **12 pass, 0 liveness rejections**. The 3
non-passes were `no face detected in any captured frame`, visually confirmed as nobody in
front of the camera. Previously: 5 liveness rejections in 25 attempts.

**Both PAM surfaces verified end to end by the operator:**

```text
sudo:        [sudo] Visage: face recognized
lock screen: pam_visage: face matched for user 'cc' → Authenticated successfully
             → hypridle: Wayland session got unlocked
```

⚠️ **The lock screen does not use `/etc/pam.d/`.** On a DMS/quickshell desktop the locker
authenticates against a generated `dankshell` config under
`~/.local/state/esver-<theme>/DankMaterialShell/pam/`, whose module set is **identical to
`/etc/pam.d/login`** — so it inherits `pam_visage` from the `login` service the module already
wires, and face unlock works with no extra configuration. Auditing `/etc/pam.d/` alone will
tell you the lock screen is unwired when it is not. Find the real path with:

```bash
journalctl | grep 'Starting pam session' | tail -1
```

## Recommended configuration

```nix
services.visage = {
  enable = true;
  camera = "/dev/video2";   # IR node — NOT video0/1
};
```

```nix
    liveness.minDisplacement = 0.1;   # see Resolution above — 0.8 costs ~1-in-6 real logins
```

The 0.8 default is not defensible on this module: it rejected ~1 in 6 genuine attempts while
the hand-held spoof (0.681) cleared the live range regardless. Raising it back buys no measured
protection. ⛔ An earlier version of this line proposed strobe-differential analysis as "the
real fix"; that was measured on 2026-09-16 and rejected — see the correction above. **No
measured anti-spoof mechanism exists for this module.** The password fallback is the control.

## Open work for this module

- [ ] Derive emitter control bytes for `3277:0055` via `linux-enable-ir-emitter configure` and
      contribute `contrib/hw/3277-0055.toml`. Known-achievable on this hardware — see the
      prior-art note in the Summary.
- [ ] Re-run the spoof matrix **with the emitter firing**. Skin and an LCD panel reflect
      infrared very differently, and active illumination may supply the physical
      discrimination the IR node alone did not.
- [ ] Test printed paper separately from an emissive screen.
- [ ] Measure displacement on *passing* attempts (`logLevel = "debug"`) to establish the live
      distribution rather than only its sub-threshold tail.
- [ ] Consider whether the emitter's strobe (~35% dark frames) interacts with `verify_n = 3`,
      since retained-frame spacing drives the displacement metric.
